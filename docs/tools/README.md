# Tools
These tools, PhoenixSuit and LiveSuit, are developed by Allwinner and are used to flash an image to an R818 based device. Windows, MacOS, and Ubuntu Linux are supported.
>`PhoenixSuit_Windows_V1.10.zip` and `PhoenixSuit_MacOS_T800.zip` are provided by the [CrealityOfficial/Creality_Sonic_Pad_Firmware](https://github.com/CrealityOfficial/Creality_Sonic_Pad_Firmware/) repository, under a GNU-GPL3 license.


`LiveSuitV306_For_Linux64.zip`, which is mentioned in the official flashing instructions, has never been provided by Creality, and instead must be found elsewhere on the internet. Take caution.


>Eventually, I plan to obtain this software directly from Allwinner and distribute it (with permission) within this repository.

For now you can find the (as of yet, untested) Linux version here:
